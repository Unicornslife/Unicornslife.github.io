Through the restructuring, Autodesk seeks to reduce its investments in areas not aligned with its strategic priorities, including in areas related to research and development and go-to-market activities.

By re-balancing resources to better align with the Company\u2019s strategic priorities, Autodesk is positioning itself to meet its long-term goals. This world-wide restructuring plan included a reduction in force of approximately 11% of the Company\u2019s workforce, or 1,027 employees, and the consolidation of certain leased facilities.
