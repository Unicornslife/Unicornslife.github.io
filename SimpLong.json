shares.</p><p><b>32</b> For purposes of determining the number of shares of stock available for grant under the 2014 Equity and Incentive Plan, each option or stock appreciation right is counted against the reserve as one share.</p><p><b>33</b> Each share of stock granted, other than an option or a stock appreciation right, is counted against the reserve as 1.61 shares.</p><p><b>34</b> If any

ammonia segment decreased by $542 million, or 36%, to $981 million in 2016 from $1.52 billion in 2015 due primarily to a 33% decrease in average selling prices and a 4% decrease in sales volume.</p><p><b>57</b> These results include the impact of the CF Fertilisers UK acquisition, which increased net sales by $26 million, or 2%.</p><p><b>58</b> The remaining decrease in our ammonia net sales of $568 million, or 37%, was due primarily to lower average selling prices and sales volume.</p><p><b>59</b> Selling prices declined due to excess global nitrogen supply.</p><p><b>60</b> In addition, our selling prices reflect the impact of a higher proportion of export sales, the volumes of which increased as a result of the weak fall application season attributable to the combined impact of weather conditions and low crop prices on our customers' decisions related to applying fertilizer in the fall.</p><p><b>61</b> Sales volume in 2016 declined due to combination of the weak fall application season and the impact of upgrading additional ammonia production at our Donaldsonville facility into granular urea and UAN as a result of our capacity expansion projects coming on line at our Donaldsonville, Louisiana complex.</p><p><b>62</b> Cost of Sales.</p><p><b>63</b> Cost of sales per ton in our ammonia segment averaged $248 per ton in 2016, including the impact of the CF Fertilisers UK acquisition, which averaged $220 per ton.</p><p><b>64</b> The remaining cost of sales per ton was $250 in 2016, a 16% decrease from the $296 per ton in 2015.</p><p><b>65</b> The decrease was due primarily to the impact of unrealized net mark-to-market gains on natural gas derivatives in 2016 compared to losses in 2015 and to the impact of lower realized natural gas costs in 2016.</p><p><b>66</b> This was partly offset by capacity expansion project start-up costs of $50 million and an increase in expansion project depreciation as a result of the new ammonia plants at our Donaldsonville and Port Neal facilities.</p>",

Interest Expense 2004 COMPARED TO 2003 Interest expense decreased $11 million to $99 million, reflecting the repayment of $234 million of senior debt in the fourth quarter of 2003 and other subsequent debt reductions, partially offset by lower capitalized interest resulting from fewer projects under construction, primarily related to our Timeshare segment.2003 COMPARED TO 2002 Interest expense increased $24 million to $110 million, reflecting interest on the mort\u0002gage debt assumed in the fourth quarter of 2002 associated with the acquisition of 14 senior living communities, and lower capitalized interest resulting from fewer proj\u0002ects under construction, primarily related to our Timeshare segment.</p><p><b>24</b> In the fourth quarter of 2003, $234 million of senior debt was repaid.</p><p><b>25</b> The weighted average interest rate on the repaid debt was 7 percent.</p><p><b>26</b> Interest Income, Provision for Loan Losses, and Income Tax 2004 COMPARED TO 2003 Interest income, before the provision for loan losses, increased $17 million (13 percent) to $146 million, reflecting higher loan balances, including the $200 million note col\u0002lected in the third quarter of 2004 related to the acquisition by Cendant Corporation of our interest in the Two Flags joint venture and higher interest rates.</p><p><b>27</b> We recognized $9 million of interest income associated with the $200 million note, which was issued early in the 2004 second quarter.</p><p><b>28</b> Our provision for loan losses for 2004 was a benefit of $8 million and includes $3 million of reserves for loans deemed uncollectible at three hotels, offset by the reversal of $11 million of reserves no longer deemed necessary.</p><p><b>29</b> Income from continuing operations before income taxes generated a tax provision of $100 million in 2004, compared to a tax benefit of $43 million in 2003.</p><p><b>30</b> The differ\u0002ence is primarily attributable to the impact of the synthetic fuel joint ventures, which generated a tax benefit and tax credits of $165 million in 2004, compared to $245 mil\u0002lion in 2003 and to higher pre-tax income.</p><p><b>31</b> In the third quarter of 2003, we sold a 50 percent interest in our synthetic fuel joint ventures, and we currently consolidate the joint ventures.2003 COMPARED TO 2002 Interest income increased $7 million (6 percent) to $129 million.</p><p><b>32</b> Our provision for loan losses for 2003 was $7 million and includes $15 million of reserves for loans deemed uncollectible at six hotels, offset by the reversal of $8 million of reserves no longer deemed necessary.</p><p><b>33</b> Income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interest gen\u0002erated a tax benefit of $43 million in 2003, compared to a tax provision of $32 million in 2002.</p><p><b>34</b> The difference is primarily attributable to the impact of our synthetic fuel operation, which generated a tax benefit and tax credits of $245 million in 2003, com\u0002pared to $208 million in 2002.</p><p><b>35</b> Excluding the impact of the synthetic fuel operation, our pre-tax income was lower in 2003, which also contributed to the favorable tax impact.</p><p><b>36</b> Our effective tax rate for discontinued operations increased from 15.7 percent to 39 percent due to the impact of the taxes in 2002 associated with the sale of stock in connection with the disposal of our Senior Living Services business.</p><p><b>37</b> Minority Interest Minority interest increased from an expense of $55 million in 2003 to a benefit of $40 million in 2004, primarily as a result of the change in the ownership structure of the synthetic fuel joint ventures following our sale of 50 percent of our interest in the joint ventures.</p><p><b>38</b> Due to the purchaser\u2019s put option, which expired on November 6, 2003, minority interest for 2003 reflected our partner\u2019s share of the synthetic fuel operating losses and its share of the associated tax benefit, along with its share of the tax credits from the June 21, 2003, sale date through the put option\u2019s expiration date, when we began accounting for the ventures under the equity method of accounting.</p><p><b>39</b> For 2004, minority interest reflects our partner\u2019s share of the synthetic fuel losses from March 26, 2004 (when we began consolidating the ventures due to the adoption of FIN 46(R)), through year-end.</p><p><b>40</b> For additional information, see the discussion relating to our \u201cSynthetic Fuel\u201d segment on

operations increased 27 percent to $2.47.</p><p><b>42</b> The favorable results were primarily driven by strong hotel demand, new unit growth, strong timeshare results, higher interest income reflecting higher balances and rates, lower interest expense due to debt reductions, lower loan loss provisions, stronger synthetic fuel results and increased gains of $58 million, partially offset by higher income taxes excluding the synthetic fuel impact, and higher general and administra\u0002tive expenses.2003 COMPARED TO 2002 Income from continuing operations increased 8 percent to $476 million, and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations advanced 11 percent to $1.94.</p><p><b>43</b> Synthetic fuel operations contributed $96 million in 2003 compared to $74 million in 2002.</p><p><b>44</b> Our lodging financial results declined $5 million to $702 million in 2003.</p><p><b>45</b> The comparisons</p><p><b>46</b> Product Specific Risks and Risk Mitigants For certain living benefits guarantees, claims will primarily represent the funding of contractholder lifetime withdrawals after the cumulative withdrawals have first exhausted the contractholder account value.</p><p><b>47</b> Due to the age of the in force block, limited claim payments have occurred to date, and they are not expected to increase significantly within the next five years, based upon current assumptions.</p><p><b>48</b> The timing and amount of future claims will depend on actual returns on contractholder account value and actual contractholder behavior relative to our assumptions.</p><p><b>49</b> The majority of our current living benefits guarantees provide for guaranteed lifetime contractholder withdrawal payments inclusive of a \u201chighest daily\u201d contract value guarantee.</p><p><b>50</b> Our PDI variable annuity complements our variable annuity products with the highest daily benefit and provides for guaranteed lifetime contractholder withdrawal payments, but restricts contractholder asset allocation to a single bond fund sub-account within the separate accounts.</p><p><b>51</b> The majority of our variable annuity contracts with living benefits guarantees, and all new contracts sold with our highest daily living benefits feature, include risk mitigants in the form of an automatic rebalancing feature and/or inclusion in our ALM strategy.</p><p><b>52</b> We may also utilize external reinsurance as a form of additional risk mitigation.</p><p><b>53</b> The risks associated with the guaranteed benefits of certain legacy products that were sold prior to our development of the automatic rebalancing feature are also managed through our ALM strategy.</p><p><b>54</b> Certain legacy GMAB products include the automatic rebalancing feature, but are not included in the ALM strategy.</p><p><b>55</b> The PDI product and contracts with the GMIB feature have neither risk mitigant.</p><p><b>56</b> Certain risks associated with PDI are managed through the limitation of contractholder asset allocations to a single bond fund sub-account.</p><p><b>57</b> For our GMDBs, we provide a benefit payable in the event of death.</p><p><b>58</b> Our base GMDB is generally equal to a return of cumulative deposits adjusted for any partial withdrawals.</p><p><b>59</b> Certain products include an optional enhanced GMDB based on the greater of a minimum return on the contract value or an enhanced value.</p><p><b>60</b> We have retained the risk that the total amount of death benefit payable may be greater than the contractholder account value.</p><p><b>61</b> However, a substantial portion of the account values associated with GMDBs are subject to an automatic rebalancing feature because the contractholder also selected a living benefit guarantee which includes an automatic rebalancing feature.</p><p><b>62</b> All of the variable annuity account values with living benefit guarantees also contain GMDBs.</p><p><b>63</b> The living and death benefit features for these contracts cover the same insured life and, consequently, we have insured both the longevity and mortality risk on these contracts.</p><p><b>64</b> The

cost.</p><p><b>39</b> Similarly, we must also determine if instruments on hand will be put to productive use or remain undeployed as a result of excess supply.</p><p><b>40</b> Reserves are established to effectively adjust inventory and instruments to net realizable value.</p><p><b>41</b> To determine the appropriate level of reserves, we evaluate current stock levels in relation to historical and expected patterns of demand for all of our products and instrument systems and components.</p><p><b>42</b> The basis for the determination is generally the same for all inventory and instrument items and categories except for work-in-progress inventory, which is recorded at cost.</p><p><b>43</b> Obsolete or discontinued items are generally destroyed and completely written off.</p><p><b>44</b>

resolve.</p><p><b>53</b> We record our income tax provisions based on our knowledge of all relevant facts and circumstances, including existing tax laws, our experience with previous settlement agreements, the status of current examinations and our understanding of how the tax authorities view certain relevant industry and commercial matters.</p><p><b>54</b> We recognize tax liabilities in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board\u2019s (FASB) guidance on income taxes and we adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available.</p><p><b>55</b> Due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities.</p><p><b>56</b> These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined.</p><p><b>57</b>

allowance for impaired loans under SFAS 114 is included in JPMorgan Chase\u2019s Allowance for loan losses.</p><p><b>30</b> Note 12 \u2013 Allowance for credit losses JPMorgan Chase\u2019s Allowance for loan losses covers the wholesale (primarily risk-rated) and consumer (primarily scored) loan portfolios and represents man\u0002agement\u2019s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the Firm\u2019s loan portfo\u0002lio.</p><p><b>31</b> Management also computes an Allowance for wholesale lending-related commitments using a methodology similar to that used for the wholesale loans.</p><p><b>32</b> As a result of the Merger, management modified its methodology for determin\u0002ing the Provision for credit losses for the combined Firm.</p><p><b>33</b> The effect of conform\u0002ing methodologies in 2004 was a decrease in the consumer allowance of $254 million and a decrease in the wholesale allowance (including both funded loans and lending-related commitments) of $330 million.</p><p><b>34</b> In addition, the Bank One seller\u2019s interest in credit card securitizations was decertificated; this resulted in an increase to the provision for loan losses of approximately $1.4 billion (pre-tax) in 2004.</p><p><b>35</b> The Allowance for loan losses consists of two components: asset-specific loss and formula-based loss.</p><p><b>36</b> Within the formula-based loss is a statistical calcula\u0002tion and an adjustment to the statistical calculation.</p><p><b>37</b> The asset-specific loss component relates to provisions for losses on loans considered impaired and measured pursuant to SFAS 114.</p><p><b>38</b> An allowance is established when the discounted cash flows (or collateral value or observable market price) of the loan are lower than the carrying value of that loan.</p><p><b>39</b> To compute the asset-specific loss component of the allowance larger impaired loans are evaluated individually, and smaller impaired loans are evaluated as a pool using historical loss experience for the respective class of assets.</p><p><b>40</b> The formula-based loss component covers performing wholesale and consumer loans and is the product of a statistical calculation, as well as adjustments to such calculation.</p><p><b>41</b> These adjustments take into consideration model imprecision, external factors and economic events that have occurred but are not yet reflected in the factors used to derive the statistical calculation.</p><p><b>42</b> The statistical calculation is the product of probability of default and loss given default.</p><p><b>43</b> For risk-rated loans (generally loans originated by the whole\u0002sale lines of business), these factors are differentiated by risk rating and maturity.</p><p><b>44</b> For scored loans (generally loans originated by the consumer lines of business), loss is primarily determined by applying statistical loss factors and other risk indicators to pools of loans by asset type.</p><p><b>45</b> Adjustments to the statis\u0002tical calculation for the risk-rated portfolios are determined by creating esti\u0002mated ranges using historical experience of both loss given default and prob\u0002ability of default.</p><p><b>46</b> Factors related to concentrated and deteriorating industries are also incorporated into the calculation where relevant.</p><p><b>47</b> Adjustments to the statistical calculation for the scored loan portfolios are accomplished in part by analyzing the historical loss experience for each major product segment.</p><p><b>48</b> The estimated ranges and the determination of the appropriate point within the range are based upon management\u2019s view of uncertainties that relate to current macroeconomic and political conditions, quality of underwriting stan\u0002dards, and other relevant internal and external factors affecting the credit quality of the portfolio.</p><p><b>49</b> The Allowance for lending-related commitments represents management\u2019s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the Firm\u2019s process of extending credit.</p><p><b>50</b> Management establishes an asset-specific allowance for lending-related commitments that are considered impaired and computes a formula-based allowance for performing wholesale lending-related commitments.</p><p><b>51</b> These are computed using a methodology similar to that used for the wholesale loan portfolio, modified for expected maturities and probabilities of drawdown.</p><p><b>52</b> At least quarterly, the allowance for credit losses is reviewed by the Chief Risk Officer and the Deputy Chief Risk Officer of the Firm and is discussed with a risk subgroup of the Operating Committee, relative to the risk profile of the Firm\u2019s credit portfolio and current economic conditions.</p><p><b>53</b> As of December 31, 2004, JPMorgan Chase deemed the allowance for credit losses to be appro\u0002priate (i. e. , sufficient to absorb losses that are inherent in the portfolio, including those not yet identifiable).</p><p><b>54</b> Market risk\u2013average trading and credit portfolio VAR</p><b>table3</b><table><tr><td>(in millions,

in 2008.</p><p><b>27</b> The decrease in \u201cDepreciation and amortization\u201d expense was primarily due to the declines in depreciation expense related to set-top boxes used in our lease programs and the abandonment of a software development project during 2008 that was designed to support our IT systems.</p><p><b>28</b> The decrease related to set-top-boxes was primarily attributable to capitalization of a higher mix of new advanced equipment in 2009 compared to the same period in 2008, which has a longer estimated useful life.</p><p><b>29</b> In addition, the satellite depreciation

compared to 2010 MST\u2019s net sales for 2011 decreased $311 million, or 4%, compared to 2010.</p><p><b>28</b> The decrease was attributable to decreased volume of approximately $390 million for certain ship and aviation system programs (primarily Maritime Patrol Aircraft and PTDS) and approximately $75 million for training and logistics solutions programs.</p><p><b>29</b> Partially

2010.</p><p><b>31</b> The decrease was attributable to decreased operating profit of approximately $55 million as a result of increased reserves for contract cost matters on various ship and aviation system programs (including the terminated presidential helicopter program) and approximately $40 million due to lower volume and increased reserves on training and logistics solutions.</p><p><b>32</b> Partially offsetting these decreases was higher operating profit of approximately $30 million in 2011 primarily due to the recognition of reserves on certain undersea systems programs in 2010.</p><p><b>33</b> Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit rate adjustments described above, were approximately $55 million lower in 2011 compared to 2010.</p><p><b>34</b> Backlog Backlog increased in 2012 compared to 2011 mainly due to increased orders on ship and aviation system programs (primarily MH-60 and LCS), partially offset decreased orders and higher sales volume on integrated warfare systems and sensors programs (primarily Aegis).</p><p><b>35</b> Backlog decreased slightly in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to higher sales volume on various integrated warfare systems and sensors programs.</p><p><b>36</b> Trends We expect MST\u2019s net sales to decline in 2013 in the low single digit percentage range as compared to 2012 due to the completion of

share, compared with $3.4 billion, or $5.74 per diluted common share, for 2010.</p><p><b>10</b> The decrease from 2010 was primarily due to an $850 million, or 6%, reduction in total revenue, a $492 million, or 6%, increase in noninterest expense and the impact of the $328 million after-tax gain on the sale of GIS recognized in 2010, partially offset by a $1.3 billion, or 54%, decrease in the provision for credit losses in 2011.</p><p><b>11</b> In addition, 2010 net income attributable to common shareholders was also impacted by a noncash reduction of $250 million in connection with the redemption of TARP preferred stock.</p><p><b>12</b> Net Interest Income Net interest income was $8.7 billion for 2011 down from $9.2 billion in 2010.</p><p><b>13</b> The net interest margin decreased to 3.92% in 2011 compared with 4.14% for 2010, primarily due to the impact of lower purchase accounting accretion, a decline in the rate on average loan balances and the low interest rate environment partially offset by lower funding costs.</p><p><b>14</b> Noninterest Income Noninterest income was $5.6 billion for 2011 and $5.9 billion for 2010.</p><p><b>15</b> Noninterest income for 2011 reflected higher asset management fees and other income, higher residential mortgage banking revenue, and lower net other-than\u0002temporary impairments (OTTI), that were offset by a decrease in corporate service fees primarily due to a reduction in the value of commercial mortgage servicing rights, lower service charges on deposits from the impact of Regulation E rules pertaining to overdraft fees, a decrease in net gains on sales of securities and lower consumer services fees due, in part, to a decline in interchange fees on individual debit card transactions in the fourth quarter partially offset by higher transaction volumes throughout 2011.</p><p><b>16</b> Asset management revenue, including BlackRock, increased $34 million to $1.1 billion in 2011 compared to 2010.</p><p><b>17</b> The increase was driven by strong sales performance by our Asset Management Group and somewhat higher equity earnings from our BlackRock investment.</p><p><b>18</b> Discretionary

Combat Systems, which designs and manufactures combat vehicles, weapons systems and munitions; Marine Systems, which designs, constructs and repairs surface ships and submarines; and Information Systems and Technology, which provides communications and information technology products and services.</p><p><b>39</b> Our primary customer is the U. S.  government.</p><p><b>40</b> We also do significant business with international governments and a diverse base of corporate and individual buyers of business aircraft.</p><p><b>41</b> Basis of Consolidation and Classification.</p><p><b>42</b> The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of General Dynamics Corporation and our wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries.</p><p><b>43</b> We eliminate all inter-company balances and transactions in the Consolidated Financial Statements.</p><p><b>44</b> Consistent with defense industry practice, we classify assets and liabilities related to long-term production contracts as current, even though some of these amounts may not be realized within one year.</p><p><b>45</b> In addition, some prior-year amounts have been reclassified among financial statement accounts to conform to the current-year presentation.</p><p><b>46</b> Use of Estimates.</p><p><b>47</b> The nature of our business requires that we make a number of estimates and assumptions in accordance with U. S.  generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).</p><p><b>48</b> These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.</p><p><b>49</b> We base our estimates on historical experience and currently available information and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances.</p><p><b>50</b> Actual results could differ from these estimates.</p><p><b>51</b> Revenue Recognition.</p><p><b>52</b> We account for revenues and earnings using the percentage-of-completion method.</p><p><b>53</b> Under this method, contract costs and revenues are recognized as the work progresses, either as the products are produced or as services are rendered.</p><p><b>54</b> We estimate the profit on a contract as the difference between the total estimated revenue and costs to complete a contract and recognize that profit over the life of the contract.</p><p><b>55</b> If at any time the estimate of contract profitability indicates an anticipated loss on the contract, we recognize the loss in the quarter it is identified.</p><p><b>56</b> We generally measure progress toward completion on contracts in our defense business based on the proportion of costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion.</p><p><b>57</b> For our contracts for the manufacture of business-jet aircraft, we record revenue at two contractual milestones: when green aircraft are delivered to, and accepted by, the customer and when the customer accepts final delivery of the fully outfitted aircraft.</p><p><b>58</b> We review and update our contract estimates regularly.</p><p><b>59</b> We recognize changes in estimated profit on contracts under the reallocation method.</p><p><b>60</b> Under the reallocation method, the impact of a revision in estimate is recognized prospectively over the remaining contract term.</p><p><b>61</b> The net increase in our operating earnings (and on a per-share basis) from the favorable impact of revisions in contract estimates totaled $350 ($0.60) in 2010, $356 ($0.63) in 2011 and $180 ($0.33) in 2012.</p><p><b>62</b> Other than revisions on the T-AKE combat-logistics ship and Specialist Vehicle programs of $53 and ($32), respectively, no revisions on any one contract were material in 2012.</p><p><b>63</b> Discontinued Operations.</p><p><b>64</b> In 2011, we recognized losses from the settlement of an environmental matter associated with a former operation of the company and our estimate of continued legal costs associated with the A-12 litigation as a result of the U.

or insurer under the representations and warranties, and corporate guarantees.</p><p><b>32</b> For further information regarding representations and warranties, and corporate guarantees, see the First Lien Mortgage-related Securitizations discussion.</p><p><b>33</b> Repurchases of automobile loans during 2009 and 2008 were due to the exercise of an optional clean-up call.</p><p><b>34</b> (3) As a holder of these securities, the Corporation receives scheduled interest and principal payments.</p><p><b>35</b> During 2009, there were no other-than-temporary impairment losses recorded on those securities classified as AFS debt securities.</p><p><b>36</b> (4) At December 31, 2009, all of the held senior securities issued by the home equity securitization trusts were valued using quoted

asset, overcollateralization and cash reserve accounts, which are carried at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value.</p><p><b>41</b> The residual interests were derived using model valuations and substantially all are classified in other assets.</p><p><b>42</b> Under the terms of the Corporation\u2019s home equity securitizations, advances are made to borrowers when they draw on their lines of credit and the Corporation is reimbursed for those advances from the cash flows in the securitization.</p><p><b>43</b> During the revolving period of the securitiza\u0002tion, this reimbursement normally occurs within a short period after the advance.</p><p><b>44</b> However, when the securitization transaction has begun a rapid amortization period, reimbursement of the Corporation\u2019s advance occurs only after other parties in the securitization have received all of the cash flows to which they are entitled.</p><p><b>45</b> This has the effect of extending the time period for which the Corporation\u2019s advances are outstanding.</p><p><b>46</b> In partic\u0002ular, if loan losses requiring draws on monoline insurers\u2019 policies, which protect the bondholders in the securitization, exceed a specified thresh\u0002old or duration, the Corporation may not receive reimbursement for all of the funds advanced to borrowers, as the senior bondholders and the monoline insurers have priority for repayment.</p><p><b>47</b> The Corporation evaluates all of its home equity securitizations for their potential to experience a rapid amortization event by estimating the amount and timing of future losses on the underlying loans, the excess spread available to cover such losses and by evaluating any estimated shortfalls in relation to contractually defined triggers.</p><p><b>48</b> A maximum funding obligation attributable to rapid amortization cannot be calculated as a home equity borrower has the ability to pay down and redraw balances.</p><p><b>49</b> At December 31, 2009 and 2008, home equity securitization transactions in rapid amortization had $14.1 billion and $13.1 billion of trust certifi\u0002cates outstanding.</p><p><b>50</b> This amount is significantly greater than the amount the Corporation expects to fund.</p><p><b>51</b> At December 31, 2009, an additional $1.1 billion of trust certificates outstanding pertain to home equity securi\u0002tization transactions that are expected to enter rapid amortization during the next 24 months.</p><p><b>52</b> The charges that will ultimately be recorded as a result of the rapid amortization events are dependent on the performance of the loans, the amount of subsequent draws, and the timing of related cash flows.</p><p><b>53</b> At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the reserve for losses on expected future draw obligations on the home equity securitizations in or expected to be in rapid amortization was $178 million and $345 million.</p><p><b>54</b> The Corporation has consumer MSRs from the sale or securitization of home equity loans.</p><p><b>55</b> The Corporation recorded $128 million and $78 mil\u0002lion of

December 31, 2009 and 2008, there were no recog\u0002nized servicing assets or liabilities associated with any of the automobile securitization transactions.</p><p><b>58</b> The Corporation recorded $43 million and $30 million in servicing fees related to automobile securitizations during 2009 and 2008.</p><p><b>59</b> The Corporation provides financing to certain entities under asset\u0002backed financing arrangements.</p><p><b>60</b> These entities are controlled and con\u0002solidated by third parties.</p><p style=\"color:red;\"><b>61</b> At December 31, 2009, the principal balance outstanding for these asset-backed financing arrangements was $10.4 billion, the maximum loss exposure was $6.8 billion, and on-balance sheet assets were $6.7 billion which are primarily recorded in loans and leases.</p><p><b>62</b> The total cash flows for 2009 were $491 million and are primarily related to principal and interest payments received.</p><p><b>63</b> NOTE 9 \u2013 Variable Interest Entities The Corporation utilizes SPEs in the ordinary course of business to sup\u0002port its own and its customers\u2019 financing and investing needs.</p><p><b>64</b> These SPEs are typically structured as VIEs and are thus subject to con\u0002solidation by the reporting enterprise that absorbs the majority of the economic risks and rewards of the VIE.</p><p><b>65</b> To determine whether it must consolidate a VIE, the Corporation qualitatively analyzes the design of the VIE to identify the creators of variability within the VIE, including an assessment as to the nature of the risks that are created by the assets and other contractual arrangements of the VIE, and identifies whether it will absorb a majority of that variability.</p><p><b>66</b> In addition, the Corporation uses VIEs such as trust preferred secu\u0002rities trusts in connection with its funding activities, as described in more detail in Note 13 \u2013 Long-term Debt.</p><p><b>67</b> The Corporation also uses

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - Continued 54 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment

and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\u201d for further discussion regarding our marketable investment securities.</p><p><b>73</b> As of December 31, 2008, our cash, cash equivalents and current marketable investment securities totaled $559 million compared to $2.788 billion as of December 31, 2007, a decrease of $2.229 billion.</p><p><b>74</b> Our principal source of liquidity during 2008 was cash generated by operating activities of $2.188 billion, approximately $750 million raised in issuing our 7 ?% Senior Notes due 2015 and the net sales of marketable and strategic investments of $166 million.</p><p><b>75</b> Our primary uses of cash during 2008 were for the redemption of $1.5 billion of debt, the purchases of property and equipment of $1.130 billion, the acquisition of 700 MHz wireless spectrum for $712 million, the distribution of $1.532 billion to EchoStar related to the Spin-off, and the repurchase of 3.1 million shares of our common stock for $83 million.</p><p><b>76</b> In addition, we reclassified $240 million of marketable investment securities on hand at December 31, 2007 to noncurrent assets during 2008 as recent events in the credit markets have reduced or eliminated current liquidity for these investments.</p><p><b>77</b> The following discussion highlights our free cash flow and cash flow activities during the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006.</p><p><b>78</b> Free cash flow.</p><p><b>79</b> We define free cash flow as \u201cNet cash flows from operating activities\u201d less \u201cPurchases of property and equipment,\u201d as shown on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.</p><p><b>80</b> We believe free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments, fund acquisitions and for certain other activities.</p><p><b>81</b> Free cash flow is not a measure determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered a substitute for \u201cOperating income,\u201d \u201cNet income,\u201d \u201cNet cash flows from operating activities\u201d or any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP.</p><p><b>82</b> Since free cash flow includes investments in operating assets, we believe this non-GAAP liquidity measure is useful in addition to the most directly comparable GAAP measure - \u201cNet cash flows from operating activities.</p><p><b>83</b> \u201d During the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, free cash flow was significantly impacted by changes in operating assets and liabilities as shown in the \u201cNet cash flows from operating activities\u201d section of our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included herein.</p><p><b>84</b> Operating asset and liability balances can fluctuate significantly from period to period and there can be no assurance that free cash flow will not be negatively impacted by material changes in operating assets and liabilities in future periods, since these changes depend upon, among other things, management\u2019s timing of payments and control of inventory levels, and cash receipts.</p><p><b>85</b> In addition to fluctuations resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities, free cash flow can vary significantly from period to period depending upon, among other things, subscriber growth, subscriber revenue, subscriber churn, subscriber acquisition costs including amounts capitalized under our equipment lease programs, operating efficiencies, increases or decreases in purchases of property and equipment and other factors.</p><p><b>86</b> The following table reconciles free cash flow to \u201cNet cash flows from operating activities.</p><p><b>87</b>

permitted by insurance regulatory authorities, which vary in certain respects from GAAP.</p><p><b>93</b> In converting from statutory accounting principles to GAAP, typical adjustments include deferral of policy acquisition costs and the inclusion of net unrealized holding gains or losses in shareholders\u2019 equity relating to certain fixed maturity securities.</p><p><b>94</b> CNA\u2019s insurance subsidiaries are domiciled in various jurisdictions.</p><p><b>95</b> These subsidiaries prepare statutory financial statements in accordance with accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the respective jurisdictions\u2019 insurance regulators.</p><p><b>96</b> Prescribed statutory accounting practices are set forth in a variety of publications of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (\u201cNAIC\u201d) as well as state laws, regulations and general administrative rules.</p><p><b>97</b> CCC follows a permitted practice related to the statutory provision for reinsurance, or the uncollectible reinsurance reserve.</p><p><b>98</b> This permitted practice allows CCC to record an additional uncollectible reinsurance reserve amount through a different financial statement line item than the prescribed statutory convention.</p><p><b>99</b> This permitted practice had no effect on CCC\u2019s statutory surplus at December 31, 2007 or 2006.</p><p><b>100</b> CNA\u2019s ability to pay dividends and other credit obligations is significantly dependent on receipt of dividends from its subsidiaries.</p><p><b>101</b> The payment of dividends to CNA by its insurance subsidiaries without prior approval of the insurance department of each subsidiary\u2019s domiciliary jurisdiction is limited by formula.</p><p><b>102</b> Dividends in excess of these amounts are subject to prior approval by the respective state insurance departments.</p><p><b>103</b> Dividends from CCC are subject to the insurance holding company laws of the State of Illinois, the domiciliary state of CCC.</p><p><b>104</b> Under these laws, ordinary dividends, or dividends that do not require prior approval of the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation \u2013 Division of Insurance (the \u201cDepartment\u201d), may be paid only from earned surplus, which is calculated by removing unrealized gains from unassigned surplus.</p><p><b>105</b> As of December 31, 2007, CCC is in a positive earned surplus position, enabling CCC to pay approximately $630 million of dividend payments during 2008 that would not be subject to the Department\u2019s prior approval.</p><p><b>106</b> The actual level of dividends paid in any year is determined after an assessment of available dividend capacity, holding company liquidity and cash needs as well as the impact the dividends will have on the statutory surplus of the applicable insurance company.</p><p><b>107</b> CNA\u2019s domestic insurance subsidiaries are subject to risk-based capital requirements.</p><p><b>108</b> Risk-based capital is a method developed by the NAIC to determine the minimum amount of statutory capital appropriate for an insurance company to support its overall business operations in consideration of its size and risk profile.</p><p><b>109</b> The formula for determining the amount of risk-based capital specifies various factors, weighted based on the perceived degree of risk, which are applied to certain financial balances and financial activity.</p><p><b>110</b> The adequacy of a company\u2019s actual capital is evaluated by a comparison to the risk-based capital results, as determined by the formula.</p><p><b>111</b> Companies below minimum risk-based capital requirements are classified within certain levels, each of which requires specified corrective action.</p><p><b>112</b> As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, all of CNA\u2019s domestic insurance subsidiaries exceeded the minimum risk-based capital requirements.</p><p><b>113</b>

from MarketXT Holdings, Inc.  (formerly known as \u201cTradescape Corporation\u201d) the following entities: Tradescape Securities, LLC; Tradescape Technologies, LLC; and Momentum Securities, LLC.</p><p><b>30</b> Disputes subsequently arose between the parties regarding the responsibility for liabilities that first became known to the Company after the sale.</p><p><b>31</b> On April 8, 2004, MarketXT filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Company, certain of its officers and directors, and other third parties, including Softbank Investment Corporation (\u201cSBI\u201d) and Softbank Corporation, alleging that defendants were preventing plaintiffs from obtaining certain contingent payments allegedly due, and as a result, claiming damages of $1.5 billion.</p><p><b>32</b> On April 9, 2004, the Company filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against certain directors and officers of MarketXT seeking declaratory relief and unspecified monetary damages for defendants\u2019 fraud in connection with the 2002 sale, including, but not limited to, having presented the Company with fraudulent financial statements regarding the condition of Momentum Securities, LLC during the due diligence process.</p><p><b>33</b> Subsequently, MarketXT was placed into bankruptcy, and the Company filed an adversary proceeding against MarketXT and others in January 2005, seeking declaratory relief, compensatory and punitive damages, in those Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York entitled, \u201cIn re MarketXT Holdings Corp. , Debtor.</p><p><b>34</b> \u201d In that same court, the Company filed a separate adversary proceeding against Omar Amanat in those Chapter 7 bankruptcy proceedings entitled, \u201cIn re Amanat, Omar Shariff.</p><p><b>35</b> \u201d In October 2005, MarketXT answered the Company\u2019s adversary proceeding and asserted its counterclaims, subsequently amending its claims in 2006 to add a $326.0 million claim for \u201cpromissory estoppel\u201d in which Market XT alleged, for the first time, that the Company breached a prior promise to purchase the acquired entities in 1999-2000.</p><p><b>36</b> In April 2006, Omar Amanat answered the Company\u2019s separate adversary

deposits and customer payables as a percentage of enterprise interest-bearing liabilities include balances not recorded on the balance sheet, such as margin and customer cash and deposits held by third parties.</p><p><b>45</b> The increase in total assets was attributable primarily to an increase of $3.7 billion in loans receivable, net.</p><p><b>46</b> The increase in loans receivable, net was due principally to growth in our one- to four-family loan portfolio during the first and second quarters of 2007.</p><p><b>47</b> Beginning in the second half of 2007, we altered our strategy and halted our previous focus on growing our balance sheet.</p><p><b>48</b> For the foreseeable future, we plan to allow our interest earning assets, particularly our mortgage-backed securities and home equity loans, to pay down, resulting in an overall decline in balance.</p><p><b>49</b> During this period, we plan to increase our excess regulatory capital levels at E*TRADE Bank as we focus on mitigating the credit risk inherent in our home equity loan portfolio.</p><p><b>50</b> In connection with this strategy and the Citadel Investment, we have updated our secondary market purchase policies to prohibit the acquisition of asset-backed securities, CDOs and certain other instruments with a high level of credit risk through January 1, 2010.</p><p><b>51</b> EARNINGS OVERVIEW 2007 Compared to 2006 Net income (loss) decreased 329% to a loss of $1.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006.</p><p><b>52</b> The decrease in net income for the year ended December 31, 2007 was due principally to the $2.2 billion loss on the sale of our asset-backed securities portfolio and an increase in our provision for loan losses of $595.1 million to $640.1 million.</p><p><b>53</b> These losses in our institutional segment more than offset the increase in our retail segment income, which increased $94.0 million to $789.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006.</p><p><b>54</b> We report corporate interest income and corporate interest expense separately from operating interest income and operating interest expense.</p><p><b>55</b> We believe reporting these two items separately provides a clearer picture of the financial performance of our operations than would a presentation that combined these two items.</p><p><b>56</b> Our operating interest income and operating interest expense is generated from the operations of the Company and is a broad indicator of our success in our banking, lending and balance sheet management businesses.</p><p><b>57</b> Our corporate debt, which is the primary source of our corporate interest expense, has been issued primarily in connection with the Citadel Investment and acquisitions, such as Harrisdirect and BrownCo.</p><p><b>58</b> Similarly, we report gain (loss) on sales of investments, net separately from gain (loss) on loans and securities, net.</p><p><b>59</b> We believe reporting these two items separately provides a clearer picture of the financial performance of our operations than would a presentation that combined these two items.</p><p><b>60</b> Gain (loss) on loans and securities, net are the result of activities in our operations, namely our lending and balance sheet management businesses, including impairment on our available-for sale mortgage-backed and investment securities portfolio.</p><p><b>61</b> Gain (loss) on sales of investments, net relates to historical equity investments of the Company at the corporate level and are not related to the ongoing business of our operating subsidiaries.</p><p><b>62</b> LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES We have established liquidity and capital policies to support the successful execution of our business strategies, while ensuring ongoing and sufficient liquidity through the business cycle.</p><p><b>63</b> These policies are especially important during periods of stress in the financial markets, which have been ongoing since the fourth quarter of 2007.</p><p><b>64</b> We believe liquidity is of critical importance to the Company and especially important within E*TRADE Bank.</p><p><b>65</b> The objective of our policies is to ensure that we can meet our corporate and banking liquidity needs under both normal operating conditions and under periods of stress in the financial markets.</p><p><b>66</b> Our corporate liquidity needs are primarily driven by the amount of principal and interest due on our corporate debt as well as any capital needs at E*TRADE Bank.</p><p><b>67</b> Our banking liquidity needs are driven primarily by the level and volatility of our customer deposits.</p><p><b>68</b> Management maintains an extensive set of liquidity sources and monitors certain business trends and market metrics closely in an effort to ensure we have sufficient liquidity and to avoid dependence on other more expensive sources of funding.</p><p><b>69</b> Management believes the following sources of liquidity are of critical importance in maintaining ample funding for liquidity needs: Corporate cash, Bank cash, deposits and unused FHLB borrowing capacity.</p><p><b>70</b> Management believes that within deposits, sweep deposits are of particular importance as they are the most stable source of liquidity for E*TRADE Bank when compared to non-sweep deposits.</p><p><b>71</b> Overall, management believes that these liquidity sources, which can fluctuate in any given period, are more than sufficient to meet our needs for the foreseeable future.</p><p><b>72</b> Capital is generated primarily through the business operations of the trading and investing and balance sheet management segments, which are primarily contained within E*TRADE Bank; therefore, we believe a key indicator of the capital generated or used in our business operations is the level of regulatory capital in E*TRADE Bank.</p><p><b>73</b> As of December 31, 2012, E*TRADE Bank\u2019s Tier 1 leverage ratio was 8.7%, an increase from 7.8% at December 31, 2011.</p><p><b>74</b> We are focused on improving the Tier 1 leverage ratio at E*TRADE Bank through deleveraging the balance sheet by a reduction in wholesale borrowings, retail deposits and customer payables.</p><p><b>75</b> We submitted an initial long-term strategic and capital plan to the OCC and Federal Reserve during the second quarter of 2012.</p><p><b>76</b> The plan included: our five-year business strategy; forecasts of our business results and capital ratios; capital distribution plans in current and adverse operating conditions; and internally developed stress tests.</p><p><b>77</b> During the third quarter of 2012, we received initial feedback from our regulators on this plan and we believe that key elements of this plan, specifically reducing risk, deleveraging the balance sheet and the development of an enterprise risk management function, are critical.</p><p><b>78</b> We submitted an updated long-term strategic and capital plan to the OCC and Federal Reserve in February 2013, which included the key elements outlined in the initial plan as well as the progress made during 2012 on those key elements.</p><p><b>79</b> We believe that our targets for capital levels at E*TRADE Bank and corresponding distributions of capital from E*TRADE Bank and its subsidiaries to the parent company will be achievable over time.</p><p><b>80</b> We plan to continue an active and ongoing dialogue with our regulators to ensure our execution of the plan is consistent with their expectations.</p><p><b>81</b> Consolidated Cash and Equivalents The consolidated cash and equivalents balance increased by $661.7 million to $2.8 billion at December 31, 2012 when compared to 2011.</p><p><b>82</b> The majority of this balance is cash held in regulated subsidiaries, primarily the Bank, outlined as follows (dollars in millions):</p>",

Provision for loan losses decreased 20% to $354.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to 2011.</p><p><b>40</b> The decrease in provision for loan losses was driven primarily by improving credit trends, as evidenced by the lower levels of delinquent loans in the one- to four-family and home equity loan portfolios, and loan portfolio run-off.</p><p><b>41</b> The decrease was partially offset by $50 million in charge-offs associated with newly identified bankruptcy filings during the third quarter of 2012, with approximately 80% related to prior years.</p><p><b>42</b> We utilize third party loan servicers to obtain bankruptcy data on our borrowers and during the third quarter of 2012, we identified an increase in bankruptcies reported by one specific servicer.</p><p><b>43</b> In researching this increase, we discovered that the servicer had not been reporting historical bankruptcy data on a timely basis.</p><p><b>44</b> As a result, we implemented an enhanced procedure around all servicer reporting to corroborate bankruptcy reporting with independent third party data.</p><p><b>45</b> Through this additional process, approximately $90 million of loans were identified in which servicers failed to report the bankruptcy filing to us, approximately 90% of which were current at the end of the third quarter of 2012.</p><p><b>46</b> As a result, these loans were written down to the estimated current value of the underlying property less estimated selling costs, or approximately $40 million, during the third quarter of 2012.</p><p><b>47</b> These charge-offs resulted in an increase to provision for loan losses of $50 million for the year ended December 31, 2012.</p><p><b>48</b> The provision for loan losses has declined four consecutive years, down 78% from its peak of $1.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008.</p><p><b>49</b> We expect provision for loan losses to continue to decline over the long term, although it is subject to variability in any given quarter.</p><p><b>50</b> capital strength.</p><p><b>51</b> The Tier 1 common ratio is defined as Tier 1 capital less elements of Tier 1 capital that are not in the
